# genetic-algorithm-demo

A simple stochastic genetic algorithm demo, using the very simple problem of
quadratic regression, to illustrate how genetic algorithms work and what makes
a "stochastic algorithm" stochastic.

Requires `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`. Playground at the end
of the notebook requires `ipywidgets` and `IPython`.
